The  goal of the `MindBoggle` repositories is to host data from https://mindboggle.info/ in a format that allows users to download specific subjects and not the entire data set.




# How the data is organized

All the data was downloaded by MindBoggle Release 3 from the Open Science Framework page: https://osf.io/9ahyp/, from the `Mindboggle101_volumes` folder.  Each tarball was downloaded and unzipped.  The `Extra-18` tarball was reorganized to be consistent with the other studies.  The format is that the top-level folder is the "study" and each subfolder is a subject with the root being the study name and then a hyphen and an index for the subject of that study.  To find the orignal source of the data, please see the README from https://osf.io/9ahyp/.

The `DKT` stands for the Desikan-Killiany-Tourville protocol. The `+aseg` refers to the FreeSurfer's wmparc + aseg non-cortical (+ white matter) labeling procedure.  Please see https://mindboggle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/labels.html for more information.  

The files include labeled surfaces and structures and unlabeled heads and brains. Each subject folder has the following files.:

- t1weighted.nii.gz - T1-weighted image
- t1weighted_brain.nii.gz - T1-weighted image with brain extracted
- labels.DKT31.manual.nii.gz - Desikan-Killiany-Tourville labeled brain
- labels.DKT31.manual+aseg.nii.gz - Desikan-Killiany-Tourville labeled brain with Freesurfer labels
- t1weighted_brain.MNI152.affine.txt - affine transformation from native space image to MNI152
